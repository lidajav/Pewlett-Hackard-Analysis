# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Project Overview

This project is to create three queries from exixting databases of employees for PH Company to do the following:

- The number of Retiring Employees by title. The list can be found in Data folder in  [unique_titles.csv](Data/unique_titles.csv)
- The count of each title is in a data file called [retiring_title_count.csv](Data/retiring_title_count.csv)
- A list of employees eligible for mentorship saved as [mentorship_eligibility.csv](Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

## Results:

- The total number of retiring employees in PH is 90,398.
- Out of this total, 33% of them are Senior Engineers followed by senior staff (31%) 
- There are only two managers to retire.
 - According to the mentorship_eligibility table there are 1549 employees are eligible to receive mentoring. 
   


## Summary :

### Recomendations:

- Based on our queries and analysis PH company has to fill 90,398 employees to replace the soon-to-become retiries. 
- There are enough senior engineers and senior staff to mentor the next generation.  
- Regarding the mentorship eligibility we can make two more queries show the number of eligible employees grouped by title and another one grouped by departments.
- We can also categorize these employees by age group and the number of years they have been working with the company to choose for mentorship.
